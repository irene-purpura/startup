        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
          Grocery shopping should feel simple. Yet for many people, it quickly becomes a stressful experience filled with
          long walks, confusing aisle layouts, and forgotten items. ShelfGuide was built to solve this problem by bringing
          intelligent navigation into the heart of the retail world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to free shoppers from unnecessary frustration and help them shop with confidence. We blend
          advanced AI, store-specific data, and thoughtful design to create a smoother and more efficient experience.
